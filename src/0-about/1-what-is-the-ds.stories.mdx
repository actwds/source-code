									The Design System is a single source of truth for the design and development of ACT Government websites and digital products and services. It works alongside the
									ACT Government{" "}

										Design Practice
									</a>{" "}
									and{" "}
									<a href="https://actgovernment.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-Communications/SitePages/Content-Playbook.aspx" target="_blank" title="ACT Content Playbook">

									</a>{" "}
									and helps teams build products and services that meet user needs and deliver great user experiences.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our design guidelines and development documentation guide teams on how to use the Design System to deliver simple and consistent solutions. Building from a
									single, best practice base ensures consistency with how our users engage and interact with ACT Government digitally. Resulting in easy-to-use products and
									services.

								<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
								<p>
									We acknowledge the advice and guidance provided by the NSW Government Digital{" "}
									<a href="https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery/digital-service-toolkit/design-system" target="_blank" title="NSW Design System">

									and team which has informed the development of the ACT Government Web Design System.

								<h2>Benefits</h2>
								<h4>Build faster and at scale</h4>
								<p>
									The design system saves time and money with an ecosystem that is made to work together. It features a library of styles, components and templates, as well as
									advice and guidance for how and when to use each one.
								</p>
								<h4>Out-of-the-box brand and accessibility compliance</h4>
								<p>
									Understand, apply and meet brand standards, with features required for brand compliance indicated with a CORE tag. Supporting the ACT Government brand guidelines,
									the design system can be used by, and bring value to any brand classification. All components and styles are also built and tested to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
								</p>
								<h4>Consistent code and design language</h4>
								<p>
									When using our foundations, components and themes, get access to fully synchronised UI and code kits for both designers and developers. This means everyone uses
									the same atomic components, with extended guidance also bridging the gap to help avoid design drift.
								</p>
								<h4>Support</h4>
